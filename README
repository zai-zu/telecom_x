# 🚀 **Telecom X - Customer Churn Analysis** 📊

Welcome to the **Telecom X - Customer Churn Analysis** project! As part of the Data Science team, our goal is to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and help develop strategies to reduce it.

### **Objective** 🎯

The project aims to analyze customer churn data from **Telecom X**, which is facing a high rate of customer cancellations. By analyzing this data, we’ll uncover insights into customer behavior and identify key drivers of churn, ultimately supporting the development of **predictive models** and **retention strategies**.

## **Key Features** 💡

* **ETL Process**: Import, clean, transform, and load data efficiently from an API.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Deep dive into the dataset to uncover trends and patterns.
* **Data Visualization**: Use of visual tools like **bar charts**, **heatmaps**, and **lollipop charts** to display churn patterns.
* **Churn Analysis**: Detailed statistical analysis to identify high-risk customers and retention strategies.

## **Installation & Setup** ⚙️

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Telecom-X.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Telecom-X
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.6+ and pip installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Required libraries** include:

   * `pandas`
   * `matplotlib`
   * `seaborn`
   * `numpy`

4. **Run the notebooks**:
   Open the `etl.ipynb` notebook for the ETL process or run the analysis script in `analytics.py`.

## **How to Run the Project** 🏃‍♂️

* **ETL Process**: Start by running the `etl.ipynb` notebook to load and preprocess the data.
* **Data Analysis**: After preprocessing, run the Python scripts in the `src/` folder to perform **EDA**, generate visualizations, and analyze churn.
* **Reports**: Once the analysis is complete, check the `reports/` folder for the **visualizations** and **final report**.

---

## **Key Insights from the EDA** 📊

* **Churn Rate**: 26.5% of customers have churned (left the service), and 73.5% have stayed.
* **Contract Type**: Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn, with a churn rate of **42.71%**.
* **Payment Methods**: Customers paying via **electronic check** have a higher churn rate (**45.29%**).
* **Internet Service**: **Fiber optic** internet customers have a higher churn rate (**41.89%**), despite its popularity.
* **Customer Tenure**: **Longer tenure** is negatively correlated with churn, meaning customers who stay longer are less likely to leave.
* **Charges**: Customers with lower **Total Charges** and shorter **tenure** tend to churn more.

---

## **Conclusion & Recommendations** 💡

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations to reduce churn:

* **Focus on month-to-month contract customers** and encourage them to switch to longer-term plans.
* **Investigate payment issues** with electronic checks and offer alternatives to improve retention.
* **Improve fiber optic service** and offer incentives to customers who might be dissatisfied.
* **Loyalty programs** for long-term customers, especially those with high charges and tenure, could help reduce churn.
